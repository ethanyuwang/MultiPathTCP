The goal of this assignment will be to create an HTTP(S) proxy server to monitor traffic coming
applications make and observe the data that is being sent over the network. In addition, you will
be able to observe how different apps use and design their different APIs to properly perform
their functions. As an extension, you will modify the responses for a specific application to
simulate a malicious attack that can be performed through such means.
Simple HTTP Proxy Server
A proxy is simply a server which sits in between a client and a destination and acts as a
middle­man between the two. The client sends the proxy server a request and the proxy server
makes a request on behalf of the client to the destination. It then accepts the destinations
response and passes it along to the client. By doing so, a proxy server is able to sniff all of the
traffic that passes between the two parties.
Your proxy server will be functioning as a server, listening for incoming client requests at a
specified port.
To implement a simple HTTP proxy server, you need to be able to perform the following
operations:
1. Parse the HTTP request line from the client
a. In an HTTP request message, there are request header and request content; and
in the request header, the first line is called request line. Request line consists of
request method, request URI and the protocol version.
b. From the request URI you need to identify the server to contact.
c. You are supposed to handle methods specified in protocol HTTP/1.1 in this
assignment.
i. Note: You don’t need to handle CONNECT command in this part
